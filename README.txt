A simple game in a Tcl canvas.

To run, double click racing.tcl (requires Tcl)

The Tcl installer is available from:
http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads

(I recommend version 8.6 or later)

Also requires Tcl SDL (https://github.com/nedbrek/tclsdl) and one mod file
for background music.

Controls:
   Arrow keys - left, right to steer
      up, down for accelerate/decelerate
